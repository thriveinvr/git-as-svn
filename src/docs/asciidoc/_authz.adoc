= Path-based authorization

:filename: _authz.adoc
include::_feedback.adoc[]

NOTE: This feature is currently only supported for `repositoryMapping: !listMapping` and `repositoryMapping: !giteaMapping`

git-as-svn supports path-based authorization that allows granting (or denying) permissions to users, very similar to Subversion http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html[path-based authorization] feature.
Typically this is done over the entire repository: a user can read the repository (or not), and they can write to the repository (or not).

It's also possible, however, to define finer-grained access rules.
One set of users may have permission to write to a certain directory in the repository, but not others; another directory might not even be readable by all but a few special people.
It's even possible to restrict access on a per file basis.

== Getting Started with Path-Based Access Control

Here's a simple example demonstrating a piece of the access configuration which grants read access Sally, and read/write access to Harry, for the path `/path/to/directory/` (and all its children) in the repository `calc`:

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /path/to/directory:
          harry: rw
          sally: r
----

Permissions are inherited from a path's parent directory.
That means we can specify a subdirectory with a different access policy for Sally.
Let's continue our previous example, and grant Sally write access to a child of the directory that she's otherwise permitted only to read:

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /path/to/directory:
          harry: rw
          sally: r
        /path/to/directory/subdirectory:
          sally: rw
----

Now Sally can write to subdirectory, but can still only read other parts.
Harry, meanwhile, continues to have complete read/write access to the whole directory.

It's also possible to explicitly deny permission to someone via inheritance rules, by using empty string or `none`:

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /path/to/directory:
          harry: rw
          sally: r
        /path/to/directory/secret:
          harry: none
----

In this example, Harry has read/write access to the entire directory, but has absolutely no access at all to the `secret` subdirectory within it.

NOTE: The thing to remember is that the most specific path always matches first.
The server tries to match the path itself, and then the parent of the path, then the parent of that, and so on.
The net effect is that mentioning a specific path in the access file will always override any permissions inherited from parent directories.

By default, nobody has any access to any repository at all.
If you want to give at least read permission to all users at the roots of the repositories.
You can do this by using the asterisk variable (`*`), which means "all users":

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /:
          '*': r
----

Note that while all of the previous examples use directories, that's only because defining access rules on directories is the most common case.
You may similarly restrict access on file paths, too.

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /README.md:
          harry: rw
          sally: r
----

You may also specify grant or restrict access only to specific branches.

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /README.md:
          harry: r
        master:/README.md:
          harry: rw
----

In this example, Harry has read access to file on all branches but has read/write access on master branch.

== Access Control Groups

git-as-svn also allows you to define whole groups of users.
To do this, describe your groups within `groups` section of `git-as-svn.conf` :

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  groups:
    calc-developers:
      - harry
      - sally
      - joe
    paint-developers:
      - frank
      - sally
      - jane
----

Groups can be granted access control just like users.
Distinguish them with an "at sign" (`@`) prefix:

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calc:
      access:
        /:
          '@calc-developers': rw
    paint:
      access:
        /:
          'jane': r
          '@paint-developers': rw
----

Another important fact is that group permissions are not overridden by individual user permissions.
Rather, the _combination_ of all matching permissions is granted.
In the prior example, Jane is a member of the `paint-developers` group, which has read/write access.
Combined with the `jane = r` rule, this still gives Jane read/write access.
Permissions for group members can only be extended beyond the permissions the group already has.
Restricting users who are part of a group to less than their group's permissions is impossible.

Groups can also be defined to contain other groups:

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  groups:
    calc-developers:
      - harry
      - sally
      - joe
    paint-developers:
      - frank
      - sally
      - jane
    everyone:
      - '@calc-developers'
      - '@paint-developers'
----

NOTE: User needs read/write access to `/` path of `master` branch in order to be able to download/upload files from git-as-svn <<_lfs.adoc#_lfs,internal LFS server>>.

== Advanced Access Control Features

git-as-svn also supports some "magic" tokens for helping you to make rule assignments based on the user's authentication class.
One such token is the `$authenticated` token.
Use this token where you would otherwise specify a username or group name in your authorization rules to declare the permissions granted to any user who has authenticated with any username at all.
You may also use `$authenticated:Local`/`$authenticated:GitLab`/`$authenticated:Gitea`/`$authenticated:LDAP` to refer to users authenticated against specific user database.
Similarly employed is the `$anonymous` token, except that it matches everyone who has not authenticated with a username.

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !listMapping
  repositories:
    calendar:
      access:
        /:
          '$anonymous': r
          '$authenticated': rw
----

== Gitea Access Control Features

When using `repositoryMapping: !giteaMapping`, the `groups` property will not be used and all group names specified for paths will be mapped to the team names of the repository's owning organization.  This allows for organization team member access to be handled through Gitea.

If a team or organization member does not normally have access to a repository in the organization through Gitea, a repository deploy key ID can be specified to override commit permissions based on the user or team's path permissions.

.git-as-svn.conf
[source,yaml]
----
repositoryMapping: !giteaMapping
  repositories:
    'organizationname/repositoryname':
      deployKey: 1
      access:
        /:
          '*': none
          '@Owners': rw
          '@Observers': r
          '@Developers': rw
        /path/to/secret:
          '@Owners': rw
          '@Observers': none
          '@Developers': none
        main:/:
          '*': none
          '@Owners': rw
          '@Observers': r
          '@Developers': r
